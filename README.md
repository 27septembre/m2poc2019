This repo is a place holder for the class practice/tuto session and for projects developped by students.

Objectives of the class are:

- To get familiar with data mining concepts 
	eg: clustering, classification, regression, reduction

- To learn about classic methods & specific vocabulary 
	eg: KMeans, ANN, features, training sets

- Practice standard analysis workflow 
	eg: scale, reduce, fit, predict, cross-validate 

- To learn how to handle data mining of large datasets 
	eg: xarray/dask-ml, pyspark, tensorflow


Material for the practice session has been developped by @gmaze
